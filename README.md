Note: This is not a CV posting or job listing solution. It is merely an open source information repository for a relatively large, but a very specific job market in one specific location.

Requirements:
- Scrape online data to discover which are the most prevalent technologies in 202X in the greater Riga area.
- Showcase this information in an online solution, so that new proffesionals are able to decern which technologies should they spend their time learning, and which ones should they look out for and which ones to generally avoid or not pay too much attention to.
- Showcase the salaries as well as other metrics related to a certain job.

Roadmap:
- Create rules for contributing to this project and the rules for maintaining it.
- Gather information about Software companies (which are to be firmly defined) and create a manually made index, to better visualize the size and and volume of the information that is to be presented here.
- Workshop a db solution, that would allow people to update the posted data, add new data, or remove old data - data IO moderation.
- Develop a web solution, where users can explore this information, using the least complicated and cheapest solution possible - both for the FE and BE.
